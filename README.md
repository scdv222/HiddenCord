# HiddenCord

Hooks into Discord and applies a setting to the window making it hidden to capture devices such as screenshots, but primarily screenshare.
This is useful to people who have one monitor and want to share their screen without leaking their discord.

## Usage
- Clone the repository to your computer
- Build it using Visual Studio
- Run it once Discord is open

You will need to rerun this program anytime Discord is opened/restarted.
